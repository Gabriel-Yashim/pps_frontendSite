                            I am creative and technically oriented, open minded to changes in tech for sustainable

                            I am experienced with purchase of the best quality materials for installation of solar
                            systems and all
                            that has to do with electricity generally.
                            I acquired a degree in Electrical Electronics which has been helpful to navigate my way
                            through the
                            challenges that comes with electricity.
                            I reside in Nigeria but travel all over the country to render our goods and services. I have
                            dedicated a

                    <h5>What is solar energy?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Solar energy is the most abundant source of energy we have available to us on Earth. It is a form of “renewable
                        energy”
                        or “clean energy” which is energy that comes from natural sources that are always available. In recent years,
                        scientists
                        have studied solar energy as a power source for homes and businesses–it now accounts for more than one-eighth of the
                        energy sources used across the United States.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h5>How does solar energy work?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Solar energy work in as much there is sunlight rays, the solar energy system works efficiently when you have a
                        professional design for your set up.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h5>How many hours does solar charges my battery in a day?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Depending on your battery bank, on a single battery bank at 15A-20A charging current, solar charge your battery full
                        within 3-5hrs a day, starting from 11am-4pm during dry season and 12pm -4pm during raining season.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h5>How many hours does a solar system work a day?</h5>
                    <p>
                        The number of hours depends on the load your solar system is powering but you can have 8 hours in a day on battery.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h5>Can I move my solar system to another location after installing?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Yes, this can be achieved at a very reasonable cost. Kindly send us a request via info.ppsolutions@gmail.com if you need
                        to relocate your solar system and we will provide the cost estimate for the relocation.</p>
